During this project, I was tasked with creating a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript

## Goals

* I have an understanding of MVC architecture
* I wrote code that is easy to change
* I know how my language works
* I can build frontend app
* I can build web apps
* I can test-drive my code

## How to use

Clone this project to your machine.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/MarcusKerr/notes-app.git
